The proposal includes background context, objectives, methodology, potential datasets/environments, evaluation metrics, a proposed timeline, and references. Feel free to adapt or refine as needed.

1. Introduction

Modern reinforcement learning (RL) methods increasingly rely on model-based approaches to improve sample efficiency and provide better interpretability. Meanwhile, intrinsic curiosity has emerged as a powerful mechanism for encouraging exploration in complex, sparse-reward environments. Leveraging these ideas for video-based tasks can significantly advance RL applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive video games, where visual and temporal information are critical.

Key Idea:
	•	Learn a latent-space model of the video environment (predictive dynamics) in an unsupervised or self-supervised manner.
	•	Use intrinsic rewards derived from prediction error or information gain to drive exploration.
	•	Integrate these modules into a model-based RL framework that plans or optimizes policies in latent space.

2. Background
	1.	Model-Based RL:
	•	Improves efficiency by learning a dynamics model of the environment.
	•	Facilitates planning (e.g., PlaNet) or latent imagination (e.g., Dreamer).
	•	Particularly suited for video data when combined with latent-state representations (reducing high-dimensional pixel inputs to more tractable latent variables).
	2.	Predictive Reinforcement Learning (PRL):
	•	Focuses on learning how future states evolve.
	•	Often uses an action-conditioned predictor (￼) to capture environment dynamics.
	•	For video, the model must handle complex spatial-temporal correlations.
	3.	Intrinsic Curiosity:
	•	Provides a self-supervised reward for exploring novel or hard-to-predict states.
	•	Techniques like the Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM) or Random Network Distillation (RND) can drive exploration in environments with sparse or deceptive external rewards.
	•	Encourages the agent to discover new frames, transitions, or video segments that challenge its predictive model.

3. Research Objectives
	1.	Objective 1: Develop a latent dynamics model that can reliably predict video sequences conditioned on an agent’s actions.
	2.	Objective 2: Integrate an intrinsic curiosity module to encourage exploration of states/transitions that are difficult to predict.
	3.	Objective 3: Evaluate whether this combined approach outperforms purely model-free baselines and standard model-based RL methods on challenging video-based tasks (e.g., partial observability, sparse rewards).
	4.	Objective 4: Investigate the transferability of learned dynamics and curiosity-driven exploration across multiple related video environments or tasks.

4. Proposed Methodology

4.1 System Architecture
	1.	Encoder:
	•	Use a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a Vision Transformer (ViT) to encode each frame into a compact latent embedding.
	•	Optionally incorporate positional encodings for temporal information.
	2.	Latent Dynamics Model:
	•	Similar to PlaNet / Dreamer:
	•	A recurrent or feed-forward network predicts the next latent state ￼ given the current latent state ￼ and action ￼.
	•	If stochastic transitions are expected, employ a probabilistic model (e.g., Gaussian or mixture of Gaussians).
	3.	Policy / Controller:
	•	A neural network that outputs actions ￼ given the current latent state ￼.
	•	Trained using an RL algorithm (e.g., PPO or Dreamer’s policy gradient in latent space).
	4.	Intrinsic Curiosity Module:
	•	Forward Model: Predicts the next latent state ￼ from ￼.
	•	Intrinsic Reward: Measured as the prediction error ￼ or an information gain metric.
	•	The total reward is ￼, where ￼ balances external and intrinsic rewards.
	5.	Reconstruction Decoder (Optional):
	•	For interpretability and potential future tasks (e.g., planning in pixel space), use a decoder to reconstruct predicted frames from ￼.

4.2 Training Procedure
	1.	Collect Data:
	•	Initialize the agent with random actions in the video environment.
	•	Store sequences of ￼ frames in a replay buffer.
	2.	Train Latent Dynamics Model & Curiosity:
	•	Model Loss:
￼
plus possible KL regularization if it’s a variational model.
	•	Decoder Loss (if using a reconstruction path):
￼
	3.	Intrinsic Reward Computation:
	•	Compute ￼, the curiosity signal.
	4.	Policy Training:
	•	Use any suitable RL algorithm (e.g., PPO, Dreamer’s actor-critic) with the combined reward signal to update the policy.
	5.	Iterate and Refine:
	•	As the policy improves, collect more data.
	•	Retrain or fine-tune the latent dynamics model periodically (or continuously in an online fashion).

5. Experimental Setup

5.1 Environments / Datasets
	•	DeepMind Control Suite (DMC) with pixel-based tasks:
	•	E.g., Walker Walk, Cartpole Swingup—these tasks produce video-like frames.
	•	Atari Games (selected):
	•	High-dimensional pixel data with complex dynamics.
	•	Realistic Simulators:
	•	CARLA (driving simulator) or AI2-THOR (embodied AI environment) to explore visual decision-making tasks.

5.2 Baselines
	1.	Model-Free Baseline:
	•	PPO or DQN that directly uses pixels as inputs without a learned dynamics model or intrinsic curiosity.
	2.	Model-Based Without Curiosity:
	•	PlaNet or Dreamer with only extrinsic rewards.
	3.	Model-Free with Curiosity:
	•	A curiosity-driven RL method (e.g., ICM, RND) but no learned dynamics model.

5.3 Metrics
	1.	Reward / Score:
	•	Standard RL objective (episodic return or success rate).
	2.	Sample Efficiency:
	•	Amount of data needed to reach a performance threshold.
	3.	Prediction Error:
	•	Accuracy of the learned dynamics model in predicting the next latent or pixel state.
	4.	Exploration Coverage:
	•	Number of unique frames/states visited as an indicator of exploration quality.
	5.	Generalization:
	•	Test the learned model or policy on slightly modified tasks or new levels to assess robustness.

6. Potential Challenges & Mitigations
	1.	Posterior Collapse:
	•	The policy may ignore latent variables if extrinsic rewards are sufficient.
	•	Mitigation: KL Annealing, Free bits techniques, or explicit weighting of the model loss.
	2.	Stochasticity in Video:
	•	Complex or unpredictable environments can degrade deterministic models.
	•	Mitigation: Use probabilistic latent dynamics (e.g., Gaussian mixture outputs) and incorporate uncertainty in planning/policy updates.
	3.	Computational Cost:
	•	Model-based methods can be expensive to train, especially with high-resolution video.
	•	Mitigation: Lower resolution inputs, or pre-trained encoders to reduce overhead.
	4.	Balancing Intrinsic and Extrinsic Rewards:
	•	Improper ￼ weighting can cause the agent to ignore the task or get stuck exploring.
	•	Mitigation: Adaptive scaling or scheduling of ￼.

7. Expected Contributions
	1.	Unified Framework:
	•	Demonstration of a single pipeline that combines latent dynamics modeling with curiosity-driven exploration for video-based RL.
	2.	Improved Sample Efficiency:
	•	Potentially fewer environment interactions needed to reach competitive performance compared to model-free baselines.
	3.	Enhanced Exploration:
	•	Intrinsic reward signals derived from prediction errors can reveal novel states, especially beneficial for sparse or deceptive tasks.
	4.	Transferable Representations:
	•	If the latent model is general enough, it could transfer to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning.
