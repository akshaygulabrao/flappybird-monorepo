# Reinforcement Learning Techniques in Flappy Bird

## Introduction
I contribute:
- A meta-survey of all work that has been done on Flappy Bird
- A hand-crafted agent capable of superhuman performance
- A review of SOTA reinforcement learning algorithms
- An updated repository for flappy bird reinforcement learning

## Flappy Bird
- Mobile game from 2013 that went viral
- Simple game mechanics make it an ideal candidate for reinforcement learning tasks
- RL environment exists at [flappy-bird-gymnasium](https://github.com/markub3327/flappy-bird-gymnasium)

## Reinforcement Learning Techniques
- Using a Q-table in Finite State Environments
- Utilizing Function Approximation instead of a Q-table

## Handcrafted evaluation function
- I used a handcrafted evaluation function to properly test certain hyperparameters of the neural network

## Simplified State Space
- How well do the other benchmarks perform?
- How well does my agent perform?
  * Parameters that impacted the performance of my agent
