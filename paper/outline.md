# How many neurons do you need to play flappy bird perfectly?

## Introduction
I contribute:
- A meta-survey of all work that has been done on Flappy Bird
- A hand-crafted agent capable of superhuman performance
- A review of SOTA reinforcement learning algorithms
- An updated repository for flappy bird reinforcement learning

## Flappy Bird
- Mobile game from 2013 that went viral
- Game mechanics
- Simple game mechanics make it an ideal candidate for reinforcement learning tasks
- RL environment exists at [flappy-bird-gymnasium](https://github.com/markub3327/flappy-bird-gymnasium)

## Reinforcement Learning Techniques
- Using a Q-table in Finite State Environments
- Utilizing Function Approximation instead of a Q-table
- Deep Q Networks

## Benchmarking Reinforcement Learning
- Best achievable average score with a score limit of 1000.
- Sample inefficiency does not count
- How close does it get to handcrafted agent. 

## Handcrafted evaluation function
- I made a handcrafted evaluation function.
- It gets approximately 900 on a training run of 10 runs with a score limit of 1000.
- I can measure the success of the reinforcement learning agents utilizing how 

## Simplified State Space
- How well do the other benchmarks perform?
- How well does my agent perform?
  * Parameters that impacted the performance of my agent

## Pixels
- Learning straight from pixels


## Conclusion
- Summary of findings
- Comparative analysis
- future work
- research implications
